# Docker Compose
Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. 
Using Compose is basically a three-step process.
1. Define your appâ€™s environment with a Dockerfile so it can be reproduced anywhere.
2. Define the services that make up your app in docker-compose.yml so they can be run together in an isolated environment.
3. Lastly, run docker-compose up and Compose will start and run your entire app.
